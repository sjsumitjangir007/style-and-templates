                                A home energy rating is an estimated calculation into a homes potential energy usage, which will determine the amount of heating and cooling required to make its occupants comfortable. It produces a star rating dependant on the amount of heating and cooling loads which will be required, from 0 to 10 stars.

                            Why do I need a 6 Star energy rating?

                                In most Australian states the government requires that all new homes and apartments (along with certain types of building extensions) built since 2010 be energy rated and achieve a minimum of 6 Stars.

                                Simple energy rating prices vary greatly on the size and type of building, generally an energy rating will cost somewhere between $130 to $700+.

                                The information required to complete a full and comprehensive energy report are the following final working drawings: Site Plan, Floor Plan, Elevations, Sections, Lighting layout and window schedule (including sizes of the existing windows).

                                Depended on the size of the extension you are building there is a chance that it too will need to be energy rated. It&#x27;s always best to check first before going ahead with construction.

                                Running existing machine learning projects in Valohai is very simple! Integration only requires adding a valohai.yaml configuration file. Moving projects in and out of Valohai is easy – the integration is only the configuration file.

                                We don’t. Valohai isn’t a data science platform; it&#x27;s a Machine Learning Management Platform that handles the whole ML pipeline from feature extraction, to training of your model and to deploying it into production in a reproducible manner. Data science platforms offer hosted notebooks and AutoML solutions.

                                Depends. Most of our customers use their own cloud and thus pay for usage according to their own agreements. Valohai doesn&#x27;t charge anything on top of the per-user license fee. If you don&#x27;t have a cloud provider, you can use our AWS, GCP and Azure accounts, and we&#x27;ll only charge you for what you use.
